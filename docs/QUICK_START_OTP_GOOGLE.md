# 🚀 Quick Setup Checklist

## Complete! ✅ Implementation is Done

All code changes have been implemented. Here's what you need to do to get it running:

---

## 🔑 Step 1: Get Google OAuth Credentials (5 min)

### Visit Google Cloud Console:
- [ ] Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
- [ ] Create new project: "Makhaantraa Foods"
- [ ] Enable "Google+ API"
- [ ] Create OAuth 2.0 Web credential
- [ ] Set Authorized redirect URIs:
  - `http://localhost:3000`
  - `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`
- [ ] Copy **Client ID** (looks like: `xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com`)
- [ ] Copy **Client Secret**

---

## 📝 Step 2: Configure Environment Variables (5 min)

### Backend (`ecommerce/server/.env`):

```env
# Google OAuth (from Step 1)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=paste-your-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=paste-your-client-secret-here
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback

# OTP Settings
OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES=10
MAX_OTP_ATTEMPTS=5

# Email Configuration (REQUIRED for OTP emails)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-digit-app-password
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Makhaantraa Foods

# Keep existing variables...
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your-existing-mongo-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-existing-jwt-secret
```

### Frontend (`ecommerce/.env.local`):

```env
# Google OAuth (same Client ID from Step 1)
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=paste-your-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-existing-stripe-key
```

## 📧 Step 3: Gmail Setup (for OTP Emails)

### If using Gmail:
- [ ] Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
- [ ] Enable 2-Factor Authentication (if not already)
- [ ] Select "Mail" & "Windows Device"
- [ ] Copy 16-digit **App Password**
- [ ] Paste into `EMAIL_PASSWORD` in `.env`

### NOT using Gmail?
- Update `EMAIL_SERVICE`, `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, etc. in `.env`

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Start the Project

### Terminal 1 - Backend:
```bash
cd ecommerce/server
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Server running on http://localhost:5000
✅ Database connected
✅ Email service ready
```

### Terminal 2 - Frontend:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "OTP not received"

1. Check Gmail spam folder
2. Verify `EMAIL_USER` & `EMAIL_PASSWORD` in `.env`
3. If using Gmail, verify app password (16 digits)
4. Check server logs for email sending errors

### Issue: "Google login shows 'invalid token'"
**Solution:**
1. Verify `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is correct
2. Check it matches in `.env` (backend) and `.env.local` (frontend)
3. Ensure redirect URIs are set in Google Cloud Console
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: "Too many attempts - must wait"
**Solution:**
1. This is rate limiting working as designed
2. Wait 1 minute or refresh page
3. Request new OTP
4. Try again

### Issue: Server won't start
**Solution:**
1. Check all `.env` variables are set
2. Verify MongoDB is running
3. Check port 5000 is available
4. Review server logs
